# GFG Daily Practice Solutions

Welcome to my personal repository where I regularly upload GeeksforGeeks (GFG) problem solutions to reinforce my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) knowledge and prepare for competitive programming and technical interviews.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is part of my consistent effort to master DSA by solving problems on GFG. The goals include:

- Practicing consistently to improve logical thinking and code quality  
- Tracking my daily/weekly progress on GFG  
- Preparing for job interviews and coding contests  
- Writing clean, efficient, and readable code  
- Sharing helpful solutions with the developer community

## 🗓️ Daily Commit Goal

I aim to solve and commit **at least 1-2 GFG problems per day**, covering a mix of easy, medium, and hard problems from various topics.

> _“Code every day. It builds discipline, sharpens your thinking, and pays off over time.”_
